Knots!

Under the utils folder there is a file named knot_builder_plus.py, which is the plus-shaped block version of the knot builder code.
knot_builder_simplified.py is the simplified block option. 
Each of these files will give an isomorphism signiture for the regina GUI to use. Note that if you wish to use the knot edges, they will only work in the origional triangulation. So, if you are using the isomorphism signiture, the knot edges will be indexed differently.



Main source repository for Regina
---------------------------------

This repository contains the sources for building Regina.

Users should only need to check out this repository if they wish to explore
bleeding-edge features that are still under development.

If you simply want the latest release, you can download ready-made packages
and/or a source tarball from http://regina-normal.github.io/#download .

To run regina from the command-line:

  * Type `regina-gui` for the graphical user interface;
  * Type `regina-python` for the python-only scripting interface.

If you encounter problems:

  * See http://regina-normal.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html for help
    with the graphical user interface and python scripting;

  * See http://regina-normal.github.io/source.html and
    http://regina-normal.github.io/buildtips.html for help with building
    Regina from sources.

Enjoy!
